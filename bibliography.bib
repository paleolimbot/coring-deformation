	abstract = {A lake sediment record from Laguna Campana at 2,488 m a.s.l. in the eastern Ecuadorian Andes allows the reconstruction of local environmental conditions over the past {\textasciitilde}500 years. A high-resolution multi-proxy approach using pollen, spore, charcoal and {XRF} analyses provides information about lake genesis, hydrological variations and the development of the surrounding vegetation. Results suggest that Laguna Campana originated from a landslide, which are naturally common and anthropogenically promoted in the study area. Human activities, e.g. deforestation or slash and burn cultivation, impacted the local vegetation development and biodiversity during the recorded period. After a first dense layer of pioneer grasses developed on open soil around the small lake, successional stages of secondary upper mountain rainforest forest mainly composed of Alnus and Weinmannia were observed. The record shows no signs of dense forest regeneration but rather open vegetation with trees and a grassy understory. Especially since ca. a.d. 1980, the proportion of forest in the area was reduced, most probably by fire use for pastures, cultivation and wood extraction. Hydrological variability was derived from differences in minerogenic input and variations in Botryococcus braunii and Sphagnum occurrence. After wettest conditions at the study site, probably triggering the landslide, humid conditions persisted until a time of drier conditions between a.d. 1900 and 1960. A subsequent return to wetter conditions was observed over the last decades. {XRF} analyses suggest an increase in deposition of atmospherically derived lead since the formation of the lake.},

	abstract = {Small, recreationally important lakes are economically critical to communities across Canada. Using a 210Pb and 14C dated sediment core from Alta Lake, Whistler, British Columbia, long-term changes in water quality were reconstructed using C/N stable isotopes, metals, and historical records. Evidence was found for a large-scale influx of terrestrial carbon at 1563±98 {AD} and channel avulsion on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan at 1754±81 {AD}. Changes in stable isotopes beginning at 1949±17 {AD} indicated increased productivity in response to nutrient loading from septic-derived nutrients. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period indicates that watershed disturbance during the construction of the highway was likely a significant contributor of metals to Alta Lake. Previous limnological assessments of Alta Lake concluded that Alta Lake is an oligotrophic, clear-water lake with excellent water quality. This study confirmed these data but indicated that nutrient loading and increased productivity in Alta Lake continue to occur. The application of the paleolimnological method to the assessment of Alta Lake confirmed that the suite of abiotic proxies used was effective in characterizing long-term trends in water quality, and that a long-term perspective on water quality variability is necessary to develop effective management practices for Alta Lake and other small, economically important lakes across Canada.},

Annual sedimentation throughout the cores (glacial varves) is identified on photographs, {ITRAX} (high-resolution continuous microfluorescence-X) and {CAT}-Scan (computerized axial tomography) analyses and is supported by (1) the number of dark and light laminations between dates obtained by radionuclide measurements (137Cs, 241Am), (2) the correlation of a slump triggered by the nearby {AD} 1881 Allemond earthquake ({MSK} intensity {VII}) and of a turbidite triggered by the {AD} 1822 Chautagne regional earthquake ({MSK} intensity {VIII}), (3) the number of laminations between two accelerator mass spectrometry ({AMS}) 14C dates, and (4) archaeological data. In Lake Bramant, dark layers are coarser, contain less detrital elements, but more neoformed elements and organic matter content. These darker laminations result from calm background sedimentation, whereas the lighter layers are finer and rich in detrital elements and reflect the summer snowmelt. Traces of mining activity during the Roman civilization apogee ({AD} 115–330) and during the Early Bronze Age (3770–3870 cal {BP}) are recorded by lead and copper content in the sediments and probably result from regional and local mining activity in the {NW} Alps. Warmer climate during the Bronze Age in this part of the Alps is suggested by (1) two organic deposits (4160–3600 cal {BP} and 3300–2850 cal {BP}) likely reflecting a lower lake level and smaller glaciers and (2) evidence of a different vegetation cover around 2500 m a.s.l. The onset of clastic proglacial sedimentation between 3600–3300 cal {BP} and since 2850 cal {BP} is synchronous with periods of glacier advances documented in the Alps and high-lake levels in west-central Europe. This major change in proglacial sedimentation highlights the development of a larger St. Sorlin glacier in the catchment area of Lake Bramant.},

Interannual varve thickness correlates with annual flood magnitude. Interdecadal trends in varve thickness are influenced by other environmental factors such as glacier recession. Despite major differences in the lakes and their contributing watersheds, substantial concordance is observed among the records. A pronounced change in the nature of lake sedimentation, accompanied by higher interannual variability, occurred in 1980. The change coincides with an increase in the magnitude of autumn flooding and major re-organization of the North Pacific climate system. These results highlight new directions for palaeoenvironmental research using varved sediment records, specifically to study the magnitude and spatial extent of past hydro-climatic events.},

	abstract = {We recovered sediment cores from Cheakamus Lake in the southern Coast Mountains, southwest British Columbia, to reconstruct late Holocene environmental conditions in the watershed. The cored sediments are inorganic, rhythmically laminated clayey silt. Radiocarbon ages and correlation of lamina thickness with the magnitude of the annual flood recorded at a nearby gauging station indicate that the laminae are varves. We discriminate seven types of varves on the basis of couplet thickness and internal structure, and compare them to annual hydrographs over the period of record. The seven varve types record summer snowmelt floods, autumn floods, mid-season floods, years with two major floods, years with three major floods, years with more than three major floods, and periods of sustained glacier runoff. Varves attributed to autumn storms and glacier runoff are dominant, exhibit serial dependence, and are most common during six periods: {AD} 1300–1320, 1380–1410, 1470–1500, 1710–1730, 1880–1906, and 1916–1945. In contrast, varves attributed to summer snowmelt floods are randomly distributed through time. Thickest varves occur during the decades {AD} 1090–1110, 1120–1170, 1210–1250, 1310–1330, 1390–1450, 1720–1780, 1860–1900, and 1920–1945. The relation between Little Ice Age glacier activity and lake sedimentation is complex, but the thickest varves coincide with times of rapid glacier retreat and periods when air temperatures were warmer than average. The results confirm the importance of sediment transfers during the summer and autumn runoff season in the British Columbia Coast Mountains.},

	abstract = {As part of a study to derive records of past environmental change from lake sediments in the western United States, a set of cores was collected from Crevice Lake, Montana, in late February and early March 2001. Crevice Lake (latitude 45.000N, longitude 110.578W, elevation 1,713 meters) lies adjacent to the Yellowstone River at the north edge of Yellowstone National Park. The lake is more than 31 meters deep and has a surface area of 7.76 hectares. The combination of small surface area and significant depth promote anoxic bottom-water conditions that preserve annual laminations (varves) in the sediment. Three types of cores were collected through the ice. The uppermost sediments were obtained in freeze cores that preserved the sediment water interface. Two sites were cored with a 5-centimeter diameter corer. Five cores were taken with a 2-meter-long percussion piston corer. The percussion core uses a plastic core liner with an inside diameter of 9 centimeters. Coring was done at two sites. Because of the relatively large diameter of the percussion cores, samples from these cores were used for a variety of analyses including pollen, charcoal, diatoms, stable isotopes, organic and inorganic carbon, elemental analyses, and magnetic properties.},

	abstract = {A ca. 9000-yr pollen, macrofossil, and sedimentological record from a laminated sediment core obtained from Susie Lake, British Columbia, reveals changes in vegetation and inferred climate during the Holocene. The pollen record indicates that a shrub and herb assemblage (ca. 9000-7800 yr {BP}) was rapidly replaced by a spruce (Picea) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest (ca. 7800-4000 yr {BP}) under the influence of warmer-than-present climate conditions. The macrofossil record indicates that an elevated treeline persisted from ca. 5200-2000 yr {BP} Pine pollen percentages increase significantly from ca. 5000-4000 yr {BP} and likely reflect the migration of P. contorta into the area. The disappearance of spruce (ca. 4000 yr {BP}) and fir (ca. 2000 yr {BP}) needles from the record indicates a gradual lowering of treeline below the elevation of Susie Lake and the establishment of the modern cold and moist climate. A pronounced increase in extralocal western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) pollen occurs at ca. 2000 yr {BP} and is coincidental with an increase in the number of debris flow--derived, fining-upward graded beds in the core. These are probably a consequence of landscape destabilization associated with treeline depression and an increase in storm frequency. Increased storm frequency may be a consequence of inland penetration of the moist Pacific air mass and the displacement of the drier continental air mass. This study suggests that substantial variations in vegetation assemblages can result from past changes in regional circulation patterns.},

	abstract = {The Isthmus of Chignecto on the New Brunswick - Nova Scotia border is the location of the Tantramar, Missaguash, and Amherst Marshes, which together form a large coastal wetland system that has been the focus of much ecosystem research and habitat modification even though little is known about the systems’ evolution. In this study, lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic lake sediment records from three lakes are used to provide a high resolution record of post-glacial environmental change for the region. Basal dates for the study lakes range from {\textgreater}10,000 cal. yr {BP} to {\textless} 4000 cal. yr {BP}, indicating that each lake provides a unique story on landscape and salt marsh evolution. Lake sediment stratigraphy indicates rapid fluctuations in lake productivity. Chemostratigraphic proxies indicate fluctuating salinity and oxygen levels in two of the three lakes and show that multiple saltwater incursions likely occurred. Analyses of metals indicate anomalously high pre-historic concentrations of Pb and Hg (8 ppm and 870 ppb respectively). Historic concentrations of Pb and Hg provide evidence for significant atmospheric deposition from industrialization and anthropogenic sources. Collectively, these data suggest that a sophisticated model is required to adequately explain the physical evolution of this extensive wetland system. Periods of sustained saltwater influx into freshwater systems were likely a fundamental driver of systems change. Additionally, both anthropogenic and natural disturbances of the lakes and wetlands have the potential to increase the bioavailability of contaminants. Management of these wetlands must take into account the sensitivity of the wetland system to environmental disturbance.},

The system has proven most effective in remote settings where the weight of a coring system may be a constraint. Cores of up to 5.5 m in length have been recovered and the system has functioned successfully in water depths to 200 m. The system weighs approximately 25 kg and costs less than \$450.00 ({US}). The percussion corer is designed for operation from a stable ice-pack surface. The core barrel assembly is lowered through the water column and driven into sediment with a weighted driver. A secondary line is used to raise and drop the driver. The driver is guided to the core barrel assembly by the main line. Cores are retrieved by a simple pulley system anchored to the ice pack.},

	abstract = {We use paleomagnetic data from cores collected at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1062 on the Bahama Outer Ridge, as well as observations from prior cruises, to quantify the nature and to assess the causes of drilling overprints. The largest overprint arises from an isothermal remanent magnetization that is imparted to the core during coring or core retrieval. A second type of overprint is apparent only in soft sediments collected with a piston corer and has coercivities and unblocking temperatures that completely overlap those of the primary remanent magnetization, which means it cannot be removed by standard demagnetization methods. This demagnetization-resistant overprint can produce significant biases in paleomagnetic observations, particularly those from split core sections. We hypothesize that shearing, which occurs as a result of friction on the inside wall of the piston corer as it rips through sediments and cuts a core, deflects the ancient magnetization. We develop and test a model that predicts how shear deformation can rotate remanence-carrying grains and deflect the paleomagnetic remanence of a split core section. Using the shear model predictions and directions measured on split core sections and U channel samples from the undeformed core center, we estimate the average deformation sustained and then correct the split core data for biases caused by shear deformation. The reduction in the deviations between corrected split core data and U channel data is statistically significant, indicating that the shear model is capable of accounting for a significant portion of the systematic biases observed in paleomagnetic observations obtained from piston cores.},

	abstract = {Both shipboard and shore-based magnetic studies of Ocean Drilling Program ({ODP}) Leg 208 sediments produced poor-quality directional data. A noisy inclination signal and a pervasive declination bias demonstrate that the sediments had been remagnetized and/or deformed. In an attempt to characterize any deformation, we carried out anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility ({AMS}) experiments on a suite of samples from Sites 1262 and 1267. Results show that the cores have suffered at least two kinds of deformation, one producing a tilting of the foliation (by up to 40° from horizontal in some intervals), and the other producing a lineated fabric. The former is firmly linked to lithology – higher carbonate content results in a higher degree of tilting – while the latter may be more closely tied to depth, suggesting the two fabrics result from different processes. The remanence directions show no obvious correlation to either fabric, suggesting that some third mechanism may have remagnetized the sediments, possibly an isothermal remanence acquired during the drilling process. In this study, the severity of the deformation may be linked to the high carbonate content of the cores, but pinpointing precise causes for both the {AMS} fabric and the directional anomalies remains elusive. It is clear, however, that the deformation is complex, pervasive and has significant implications for the interpretation paleomagnetic data from Leg 208.},
